7 Days to Die (7DTD) - Auto-Reveal Map

A common theme with people generating their own 7dtd maps, is they wish to be able to preview the entire map before they spend countless hours with friends playing the map. This project seeks to help try and bridge that gap by teleporting the first player (or next player, if you blank out your 7DTD server log), entirely around your map.

This process takes hours. But to the best of my knowledge, there is no other way to get such a detailed map preview.

This requires a few things:

- A Linux 7DTD Server
- Alloc's Fixes installed to the 7DTD to provide the Webinterface and awesome map rendering
- Bad Company to provide a telnet console command that can be used to teleport a player to x, z, y coordinates
- Telnet to be enabled on your 7DTD server

The intention is for you to run this script right before the first player (you) connects to your server. If you want to run this later on a server that is already up, I would suggest blanking out your 7DTD log file.
